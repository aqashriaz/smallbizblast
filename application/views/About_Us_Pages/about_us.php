		<div>
		     
			<p class="header2" align="justify">
		   <b>1.</b> Visiting the community's SmallBizBlast “Community Deals” website: The city, town or chamber is given a SmallBizBlast logo-banner they can place on their website or anywhere else they like. They would just need to link it to their community’s SmallBizBlast “Community Deals” page.
			</p>
			<p class="header2" align="justify">
			<b>2.</b>Signing up for the SmallBizBlast weekly email: The city, town or chamber chooses which day of the week the email goes out. They can also choose to have it go out twice per week rather than once if they like.

			 <h5 class= "pb_participating2" >How do the deals get there? </h5>
			 <p class="header2" align="justify">
			     Businesses that meet the criteria determined by the local municipality or chamber of commerce click the "Add My Business" link on that community’s Community Deals page, review the eligibility criteria, then complete the short form. Once they're approved (by the sponsoring municipality or chamber) they can begin posting deals.</p>
			     <p class="header2" align="justify">

                Once per week (you choose which day), at midnight, the website is updated with the new weekly deals posted by businesses throughout the last week, and the SmallBizBlast email goes out the next morning to those residents that have signed up.

				 Now, cities and towns can promote a dynamic, low-maintenance, easy-to-use website that lists weekly-fresh, great deals from their local small businesses, giving residents a reason to shop small and explore local businesses (cities and towns can promote their business community in general, but the businesses themselves need to earn the resident’s business). A city or town that promotes its small business community is an incredibly effective business attraction tool. Developing relationships between its residents and small business community develops a stronger economy and helps sustain small businesses during difficult times

            Think of it, the best deals from all your local small businesses going out to your residents on a weekly basis! Residents will see deals from not only those businesses they already know and love, but other local, small businesses that perhaps they weren’t aware of!
